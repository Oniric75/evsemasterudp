EVSE Master UDP - Python Home Assistant Integration

This project is an independent Python reimplementation for Home Assistant inspired by,
and referencing, the reverse-engineered protocol knowledge from the TypeScript project:
  https://github.com/johnwoo-nl/emproto

No original source files from that repository were copied verbatim; the implementation
was rewritten in Python based on publicly observable protocol behavior and conceptual
structure.
